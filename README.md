# Shallow Geothermal Energy Development

This repository is currently under development.  
It already includes:
- A presentation (`Shallow geothermal energy.pptx`)
- A Python demo script (`geothermal_demo.py`) showing basic geothermal calculations

Upcoming additions:
- Extended Python models (seasonal variation, efficiency scenarios)
- More case studies and documentation
- Visual outputs and example datasets

We are presenting this project today in its current state to share progress and invite collaboration.
