# Shallow Geothermal Energy Development

This repository is currently under development.  
It already includes:
- A presentation (`Shallow geothermal energy.pptx`)
- A Python demo script (`geothermal_demo.py`) showing basic geothermal calculations

Upcoming additions:
- Extended Python models (seasonal variation, efficiency scenarios)
- More case studies and documentation
- Visual outputs and example datasets

We are presenting this project today in its current state to share progress and invite collaboration.

Ifeanyi and Clément demonstrate that Shallow Geothermal Energy is highly efficient and operates on a 24/7 basis, unlike solar and wind energies, with respect to the resources and proven projects reviewed around the world.
